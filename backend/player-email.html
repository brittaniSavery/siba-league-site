            <p>Thank you for joining! We look forward to chatting with you in our <a href="#">Slack community</a>. If
                you haven't joined already, be sure to do so and say hi in the general channel. From there, one of the
                commissioners will add you to the channels for the pro/college league.</p>
            <p>Below are some friendly reminders for getting up and running to manage your team(s).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game versions</li>
                <li>Graphics</li>
                <li>Verify teams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thanks once again for joining! Tell your friends about the leagues if they love basketball, numbers, and
                stats too.
                There are plenty of teams available, some really good ones too.
