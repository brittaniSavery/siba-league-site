# Simulation International Basketball Assoication (SIBA)

The Simulation International Basketball Assoication (SIBA) is a fictional basketball league created by my father and me as a way to bond over our love of basketball 🏀 and stats 👩🏾‍🔬. I used this opportunity to learn more about React, serverless architecture, and graphic design. If you're curious about the league itself, feel free to check it out [here](https://www.siba.averyincorporated.com/).

## Frontend (and related things)

SIBA's frontend is a React application, originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and styled using [React-Bootstrap v3](https://react-bootstrap-v3.netlify.app/). There is also a folder that currently holds `.php` files for file management.

## Backend

SIBA's backend leverages the [Severless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to create APIs and lambda functions in AWS.
