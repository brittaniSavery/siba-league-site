    <h2>The SIBA</h2>
    <p>
      The Simulation International Basketball Assoication (SIBA for short) and
      its related leagues (the developmental and colleg leagues) was the
      combined efforts of Kelley and Brittani Avery, a father and daughter team.
      Sharing a love of basketball and statistics, they worked together to
      create the league as a way to spend quality time together. Kelley created
      the teams, logos, and rules of the league while Brittani provided her
      technical expertise to build the website and other important tools to
      support it.
