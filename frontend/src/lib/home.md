In the pro league, round one of the playoffs have begun and here are the match-ups.

**Eastern Conference**  
#1 New York Metros vs #8 Memphis Vandals
#2 Indiana Express vs #7 New Jersey Hoops
#3 Montreal Argonauts vs #6 Philadelphia Silverbacks
#4 Chicago Guardians vs #5 Columbus Barons

**Western Conference**  
#1 Kansas City Koyotes vs #8 Vancouver Rain
#2 Phoenix Scorpions vs #7 Houston Stampede
#3 Portland Rhinos vs #6 Oklahoma City Twisters
#4 Dallas Rangers vs #5 Seattle Sasquatch

Chicago didn't seem to have as great of a year this season compared to last year as the number one seed, ending up as the fourth instead. The Hoops also had a set back, going from 2nd to 7th this year. The Montreal Argonauts, despite major roster changes, stayed steady at spot number 3. The Indiana Express improved this season as well, now as the #2 team in the East compared to #4 last year. Philly and Columbus are returning to the playoffs as well with slightly higher spots compared to last year. In the #8 spot, we have a newcomer to the playoff scene, Memphis. Their new GM Jay Tinaan had little time in adjusting to his position, so it'll be interesting to see if his team can pull off a major upset against the Metros.

It is exciting to see Kansas City recover from the devastating injury and disappointing season last year. The defending champs of the Phoenix Scorpions make another appearance in the playoffs and it is expected that they will do well. Dallas returns as well, still managing to get home court advantage despite the lower rank from last year. Portland, Seattle, and OKC are in or around the same spots as they were last year. However, the Vancouver Rain make their first playoff appearance and we look forward to seeing how they compete against the team with the best record in the league.

### May 1, 2021

With the final games of the SIBA season in full swing, the battle for the 16 playoff spots intensifies. The Eastern Conference has 6 teams in the hunt for the last three playoffs spots and the Western Conference has 5 teams fighting for the last four spots with 4.5 games separating them. Stayed tuned for the final playoff match-ups in the next few days.

We also have a new GM taking over for the Memphis Vandals. Please welcome Jay Tinaan!

In the college league, it's tournament time and there have been plenty of activity as teams battle in the main tournament or one of the secondary tournaments. We'll be sure to update on the process of the tournaments as they continue on.
