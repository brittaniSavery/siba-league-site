The Simulation International Basketball Association (SIBA) and its related college (SICBA) and developmental (DBL) leagues are a fictional basketball simulation league using the Draft Day Sports: Basketball programs by Wolverine Studios. In the professional league of SIBA, 30 teams and 30 GM all plan, recruit, trade, train, and play in order to take home the coveted prize of the SIBA Championship. Will you be league champion? Or would you rather be the head of your own college basketball program? In the college league of the SICBA, universities and college from all around the United States battle each other to bring the championship to their school.

Whatever your play style, join the SIBA and/or the SICBA and test your basketball coaching and management skills!

With the 2019-2020 SIBA season officially completed, a champion has been crowned! The Philadelphia Silverbacks started the series out with a bang, crushing Phoenix on their home court 152 to 136. Ales Hare and Jason Thomas dominated the court with 40 and 45 points respectively. However, things quickly turned in Phoenix's favor, starting in Game 2. Both teams played to their strengths and traded leads throughout the game. However, Phoenix came out on top in the end, 118 to 108. Darrin Johnson had a double-double with 33 points and 10 assists. In Game 3, Johnson's dominance continued as his 30 points and 9 assists pushed Phoenix to lead most of the first half. However, Philly's big three of Thomas, Sheppard, and Hare were not to be counted out just yet. In the second half, Phoenix seemed to kick the pace of the game into overdrive and were much more aggressive defensively with steals and blocks. Johnson did more of the same and ended the game with 48 points and 15 assists. The Silverbacks just could never quite catch the Scorpions and retake the lead. The final score was 123 to 121.

Phoenix gained an early lead in Game 4 and never allowed Philly to lead in the entire first half. The largest lead was 17, but at half, Philly cut it down to 6. In the third quarter, the Silverbacks bounced back into the game, trading ties and leads with Phoenix. At the start of the fourth quarter, it was tied at 101. Only 12 minutes stood between a tied series or with a significant 3-1 lead for Phoenix. Back and forth the teams went, it was still anybody's game until around the 5:00 mark. Philly got into a bit of foul trouble with them in the penalty, all fouls meant free throws. Those shots were made and in the end, Phoenix won 144 to 141. With that commanding series lead 3-1 and the Silverbacks suffering injuries in some of their key players, the Phoenix Scorpions won the Game 5 and the series 4 to 1, becoming the 2019-2020 SIBA champions! Congratulations!
