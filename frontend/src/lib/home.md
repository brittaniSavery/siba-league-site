The Simulation International Basketball Association (SIBA) and its related college (SICBA) and developmental (DBL) leagues are a fictional basketball simulation league using the Draft Day Sports: Basketball programs by Wolverine Studios. In the professional league of SIBA, 30 teams and 30 GM all plan, recruit, trade, train, and play in order to take home the coveted prize of the SIBA Championship. Will you be league champion? Or would you rather be the head of your own college basketball program? In the college league of the SICBA, universities and college from all around the United States battle each other to bring the championship to their school.

Whatever your play style, join the SIBA and/or the SICBA and test your basketball coaching and management skills!

## Updates

### December 13, 2020

The first round of the professional playoffs have come to a roaring finish. In the West the #8 Kansas City Koyotes pushed the #1 Phoenix Scorpions to seven games. Despite the Koyotes' efforts, Darrin Johnson scored a massive 46 Points in Game 7 and helped the Scorpions earn their place in the second round.

In the #2 Dallas Rangers vs #7 Oklahoma City Twisters series, the teams traded games for the first four. However, the Rangers took charge of the last two games. Chris Cunningham (42 Points, 14 Rebounds/Game 5) and Michael Lee (32 Points and 6 Assists/Game 6) took the lead in Games 5 and 6.

With the first two games of the #3 Portland Rhinos vs #6 Seattle Sasquatch series split, Game 3 was forced into overtime by Seattle, scoring 34 points in the fourth quarter and tieing the game. The Rhinos answered back, though, outscoring the Sasquatch and winning Game 3. Corey Riley from the Rhinos quite easily earned Player of the Game with a triple-double: 32 Points, 10 Assists, and 18 Rebounds. Game 4 was a bit of a do-or-die moment for the Sasquatch, since they needed to win and avoid going down 3-1. Another tight game, it went down to the wire in overtime with the Rhinos winning by two points, 126 to 124. In the end, the Rhinos won the series and are heading to the second round to face the Dallas Rangers.

The #4 Denver Peaks started out great, winning the first two games. However, things turned in the #5 Houston Stampede's favor in Game 3. They came out fierce in the first half and while the Peaks attempted to make a comeback, it wasn't enough. The Stampede won Game 3 114 to 113. They used that momentum to win the next three games and thus, the series. Their next opponent will be the Scorpions.

Moving to the Eastern Conference, the turbulent fight to earn a spot in the playoffs seemed to have died off or at the very least fizzled down. There were two sweeps. The #1 Chicago Guardians, with the fourth best record in the league during the regular season, knocked out the #8 Boston Nighthawks in four run-of-the-mill games. The second sweep might come as a surprise. Nick Slaughter, the starting small forward for the #2 New Jersey Hoops, injured his ankle one game before the start of the playoffs. This crippled the Hoops' offense and the #7 Philadelphia Silverbacks took advantage of their opponent's weakness. While one of the four games went into overtime and another had only a two-point difference in the final score, the Hoops could not regroup. With their unexpected sweep, the Silverbacks are in the semi-finals.

The #3 Montreal Argonauts vs #6 Columbus Barons series was basically a replay of the regular season. The Argonauts have struggled against the Barons, being 1-2 against them (both loses were lost by double digits). While Game 2 was a huge win for the Argonauts, led by Willie Favors' 47 points, the Barons finished strong and won the series. The young point guard from Russia, Yevgeny "Geny Pig" Davidenko, had a great game to end the series and even earned Play of the Game with 29 points and 10 assists.

Finally, the #4 Indiana Express vs #5 New York Metros series had a great start for Indiana despite two of their starters (Abraham Hirsch and Collier Perez) being injured. While Game 1 went into overtime, the next two games were fairly standard wins. However, more injuries plied on: Lamoni Price with a sore hand, Kenneth Gibson with a strained knee, Beau Smiley with a broken nose, and Ron Cliff with a mild concussion. In Game 4, Indiana only had seven available players. In Game 5, they only had six. Some players stayed on the court for the full 48 minutes for multiple games. One can only imagine how exhausted they must have been. This allowed New York to sweep the last four games necessary to win the series. Not a normal seven-game series but surely an interesting one.

After the first round, we have these match-ups:

**Eastern Conference**  
#1 Chicago Guardians vs #5 New York Metros  
#6 Columbus Barons vs #7 Philadelphia Silverbacks

**Western Conference**  
#1 Phoenix Scorpions vs #5 Houston Stampede  
#2 Dallas Rangers vs #3 Portland Rhinos
