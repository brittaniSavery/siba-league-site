## Updates

### May 14, 2021

Round 1 of the playoffs are in the books and we're heading into Round 2. Out of the eight matchups, only one team was able to sweep their competitor. It was a compelling set of series. Let's break them down!

**Eastern Conference**

**#1 New York Metros vs #8 Memphis Vandals:** In Games 1 and 2, the Metros kept the Vandals under 100 points. While they led for most of the game in Game 1, Game 2 was a different story with 19 lead changes and 8 ties. Yet, New York made a push in the fourth quarter and got the win. As the series moved to Memphis, the Vandals seemed to get a boost from their home court and took Game, only winning by three points. All starters for both teams had double-digit points and several players had double-doubles. It was a tight game down to the end. In Game 4, Memphis had a bit of a slow start, but Keith Bond gave his team a major kick in the bum at halftime and they came storming back and winning the game, 123 to 116. Game 5 was back in New York and while it was a close game in the first half, it seemed that the Metros also had a kick from their coach, Nate Williams, and won the game as well as keeping the Vandals under 100 points. Game 6 was dominated by the home team of Memphis, despite the close final score of 119 to 111 and having lost a lead of 21.

It was three games to three and Game 7 was needed. Throughout the series, both teams had played excellently on their home courts. Yet, both teams knew that anything could happen in a Game 7, so they brought the A-game. It was a constant back-and-forth between the teams with multiple lead changes and ties. However, Memphis managed to pull ahead just slightly in the fourth quarter and won the game 133 to 127. Pulling a major upset over New York, Memphis advance to the second round.

**#2 Indiana Express vs #7 New Jersey Hoops:** The beginning of the series for the Express and the Hoops was a little strange since they had just played each other twice in a row. So, each team seemed to have gotten a bit of practice in before the series actually started. Despite having one the game right before Game 1, Nwe Jersey took Game 1, never allowing Indiana a chance to lead and only tying twice. Yet, that would be the only game that the Hoops would win. The next four games were all Indiana. Games 2, 3, and 4 were all won by double dights, 12 points or more. New Jersey put up more of a challenge in Game 5, but in the end, Indiana came out on top to advance to round 2.

**#3 Montreal Argonauts vs #6 Philadelphia Silverbacks:** In Games 1-4, both teams won (quite thoroughly) a home game and an away game, leaving the series tied at 2-2. In Game 5, it seemed that foul trouble was the main problem for the Argonauts. Three of their players (two starters and their sixth man) fouled out, causing them to depend more on their young and inexperienced bench. With a solid performances from Jason Thomas (29 points and 12 rebounds) and Ales Hare (20 points adn 10 rebounds), the Silverbacks won Game 5. After the low scoring effort from Montreal, they came to Philly and Game 6 with renewed energy. Willie Favors had a massive game with 44 points and 5 assists. However, this was not enough to win the game as both Jason Thomas (38 points) and Ales Hare (35 points) had monster games as well. With the Silverbacks winning Games 5 and 6, they're heading to the second round.

**#4 Chicago Guardians vs #5 Columbus Barons:** Both teams came out the gate strong, though Chicago only had a 14-point third quarter. That may have been one of the major contributing factors of Chicago's lost in Game 1. The tables turned in Game 2 as both Leighton Langhi (25 points, 11 asissts, and 10 rebounds) and Murray Webb (32 and 8 rebounds) had major games. The bidding star of Yevgeny "Geny Pig" Davidenko didn't have his best game, scoring only 5 points. However, other starters of the Barons such as Shawn Duncan and Marius Oliver managed to keep Columbus in the game. In the end, Chicago won 115-105.

The Barons easily won Games 3 and 4, using that home court advantage. Game 5, back in Chicago, had plenty of lead changes and times as Chicago fought to stay alive and Columbus attempt to make the killing strike. The game went into overtime where the Guardians scored twice as many points as the Barons, focusing a Game 6. Columbus took charge in the beginning of Game 6, but the Chicago wasn't going to down quietly. They came back hard in the third quarter, but the Barons outscored them just slightly in the fourth. With that Game 6 win, the Barons were heading to Round 2.

**Western Conference**

**#1 Kansas City Koyotes vs #8 Vancouver Rain:** In Games 1 and 2, the Koyotes kept the Rain under 100 points and ended up winning both games by double digits. The Rain, on their home court, came back with vengeance and managed to put more pressure on the Koyotes. In the end, Kansas City still won but only by 4 points. With that momentum going into Game 4, the Rain took charge, holding the lead for majority of the game. Kansas City attempted to make a comeback in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough. Vancouver took Game 4 125 to 117.

At the start of Game 5, Vancouver looked to have kept the momentum despite the Koyotes now playing on their home court. However, momentum shifted back into the Koyotes' favor as they dominated their second quarter. They went into the half with a lead of 61 to 49. Both teams fought for control in the second half with Kansas City taking the third quarter and Vancouver taking the fourth. In the end, the Koyotes won the series and are heading to the second round.

**#2 Phoenix Scorpions vs #7 Houston Stampede:** In the first games, Phoenix made to let everyone that the returning champs have made it to the playoffs. Darrin Johnson put up 48, 20, 31 and for the first three games respectively and several of their other players put great numbers as well, such as Brent Nelson with 36 points in Game 3. Houston's starters all double-digits in Game 4, which helped the Stampede to gain the win. Dekker Whitehead scored 32 points and ahd 8 assists and 7 rebounds. Isaac Smith also had double-double with 14 points and 17 rebounds. Foul trouble seemed to be a bit of a problem for Phoenix during this game, which led to 33 Free Throw Attempts (and 27 made) for Houston. However in Game 5, Phoenix led the entire game with its largest lead being 25 points. Darrin Johnson had 43 points and 9 assists. Doylan Goree had a trouble double with 28 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 blocks. With that crushing defeat of Houston, Phoenix moves to the next round.

**#3 Portland Rhinos vs #6 Oklahoma City Twisters:** The series started out with a fight to the finish! 28 lead changes and 17 ties, the Twisters and Rhinos battled for dominance of the series. After overtime, the Rhinos came out on top, 135 to 128. Josh Autry earned player of the game with 35 points and 13 rebounds. OKC definitively took Game 2, leading the entire game. Neither team seemed to have a great time at the free throw line, only shooting around 60%. Those missed points could have made the difference for Portland.

With the series moving to OKC and the Twisters having a solid win, analysts thought it would be a more interesting series. However, Portland took the next three games as well as the entire series. In Game 4, they won by 20 points while the other two games were much closer. Despite the great beginning effort of the Twisters, the Rhinos are advancing to Round 2.

**#4 Dallas Rangers vs #5 Seattle Sasquatch:** In Games 1 and 2, Dallas took a double-digit lead after one quarter and never allowed Seattle to catch them. After the series switched to Seattle and the Sasquatch had the support of their fans and the comforts of home, they found their fighting spirit and went back and forth with Dallas. Yet, Dallas held on and still managed to win against Seattle. Game 4 saw more fight and grit from the Sasquatch, even having the largest lead of the game at one point. It still wasn't enough and Dallas got the sweep.

So the match-ups for Round 2 are:

**Eastern Conference**  
#8 Memphis Vandals vs #5 Columbus Barons  
#6 Philadelphia Silverbacks vs #2 Indiana Express

**Western Conference**  
#1 Kansas City Koyotes vs #4 Dallas Rangers  
#3 Portland Rhinos vs #2 Phoenix Scorpions

**Eastern Conference**

- #1 New York Metros vs #8 Memphis Vandals
- #2 Indiana Express vs #7 New Jersey Hoops
- #3 Montreal Argonauts vs #6 Philadelphia Silverbacks
- #4 Chicago Guardians vs #5 Columbus Barons

**Western Conference**

- #1 Kansas City Koyotes vs #8 Vancouver Rain
- #2 Phoenix Scorpions vs #7 Houston Stampede
- #3 Portland Rhinos vs #6 Oklahoma City Twisters
- #4 Dallas Rangers vs #5 Seattle Sasquatch

Chicago didn't seem to have as great of a year this season compared to last year as the number one seed, ending up as the fourth instead. The Hoops also had a set back, going from 2nd to 7th this year. The Montreal Argonauts, despite major roster changes, stayed steady at spot number 3. The Indiana Express improved this season as well, now as the #2 team in the East compared to #4 last year. Philly and Columbus are returning to the playoffs as well with slightly higher spots compared to last year. In the #8 spot, we have a newcomer to the playoff scene, Memphis. Their new GM Jay Tinaan had little time in adjusting to his position, so it'll be interesting to see if his team can pull off a major upset against the Metros.

It is exciting to see Kansas City recover from the devastating injury and disappointing season last year. The defending champs of the Phoenix Scorpions make another appearance in the playoffs and it is expected that they will do well. Dallas returns as well, still managing to get home court advantage despite the lower rank from last year. Portland, Seattle, and OKC are in or around the same spots as they were last year. However, the Vancouver Rain make their first playoff appearance and we look forward to seeing how they compete against the team with the best record in the league.

### May 1, 2021
