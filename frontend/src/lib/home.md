The Simulation International Basketball Association (SIBA) and its related college (SICBA) and developmental (DBL) leagues are a fictional basketball simulation league using the Draft Day Sports: Basketball programs by Wolverine Studios. In the professional league of SIBA, 30 teams and 30 GM all plan, recruit, trade, train, and play in order to take home the coveted prize of the SIBA Championship. Will you be league champion? Or would you rather be the head of your own college basketball program?

With the 2019-2020 SIBA season officially completed, a champion has been crowned! The Philadelphia Silverbacks started the series out with a bang, crushing Phoenix on their home court 152 to 136. Ales Hare and Jason Thomas dominated the court with 40 and 45 points respectively. However, things quickly turned in Phoenix's favor, starting in Game 2. Both teams played to their strengths and traded leads throughout the game. However, Phoenix came out on top in the end, 118 to 108. Darrin Johnson had a double-double with 33 points and 10 assists. In Game 3, Johnson's dominance continued as his 30 points and 9 assists pushed Phoenix to lead most of the first half. However, Philly's big three of Thomas, Sheppard, and Hare were not to be counted out just yet. In the second half, Phoenix seemed to kick the pace of the game into overdrive and were much more aggressive defensively with steals and blocks. Johnson did more of the same and ended the game with 48 points and 15 assists. The Silverbacks just could never quite catch the Scorpions and retake the lead. The final score was 123 to 121.

Phoenix gained an early lead in Game 4 and never allowed Philly to lead in the entire first half. The largest lead was 17, but at half, Philly cut it down to 6. In the third quarter, the Silverbacks bounced back into the game, trading ties and leads with Phoenix. At the start of the fourth quarter, it was tied at 101. Only 12 minutes stood between a tied series or with a significant 3-1 lead for Phoenix. Back and forth the teams went, it was still anybody's game until around the 5:00 mark. Philly got into a bit of foul trouble with them in the penalty, all fouls meant free throws. Those shots were made and in the end, Phoenix won 144 to 141. With that commanding series lead 3-1 and the Silverbacks suffering injuries in some of their key players, the Phoenix Scorpions won the Game 5 and the series 4 to 1, becoming the 2019-2020 SIBA champions! Congratulations!

### January 3, 2021

The SIBA finals have been announced! The Phoenix Scorpions took an early lead in the series by winning the first two games at home against the Dallas Rangers. However, Dallas was determined not to go down without a fight and won Game 3, Johnny Burton leading the Rangers with 40 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds. The momentum that the Rangers gained from the Game 3 win faded after the intense back and forth in Game 4. Dallas lost a 22-point lead and eventually lost the game by two points, 116 to 114. The Scorpions finished the job in Game 5 by demolishing the Rangers, 120 to 102.

In the Chicago Guardians vs the Philadelphia Silverbacks series, things were looking rather bleak for the Silverbacks in the first two games at Chicago. In Game 1, Leighton Langhi, starting small forward for the Guardians, had 53 points and 11 assists and pushed his team ahead to win in the end, 131 to 124. In Game 2, all of the starters had double digit points and three of them had more than 20 points. Murry Webb even had 37 points. However once the games shifted to Philly, the Silverbacks took both Games 3 and 4, evening up the series. Both teams came to play in Game 3, but the Guardians were unable to fully recover from the double digit lead that the Silverbacks had at halftime. In the end, Philly won 123 to 111. Game 4 was more of the same with Philly winning 128 to 113, Jason Thomas leading in points (38).

At 2-2, it was now anybody's game. In Game 5, it was a battle from the start with 23 lead changes and 9 ties. Leighton Langhi had another outstanding game with 39 points and 6 assists. Yet, Brett Sheppard (27 points and 12 rebounds), Ales Hare (22 points), and Jason Thomas (36 points) all had amazing games as well and with their combined efforts, overpowered Chicago starting from the second quarter.

Back at home in Philly, the Silverbacks took control of Game 6, earning their place in the SIBA finals by winning by 23 points (130 to 107). Ales Hare once again put on a show: 42 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds.

The stage is finally set for the finals: the Phoenix Scorpions vs the Philadelphia Silverbacks. The champion will be crowned soon!

Congratulations to the Wisconsin Badgers, the champions of the 2020 SICBA tournament! With a record of 39 wins and 1 single loss, they had one of the best records in the entire league. In the championship game, they shot 53% from the three-point line and two of their starters scored 20 or more points. This was certainly an amazing finish to a great season.

With the end of the season comes end of the season awards. Stay tuned for a full breakdown of the awards for the entire association as well as individual conferences.

In the pro league, the Phoenix Scorpions beat out the Houston Stampede 4 to 1. The Portland Rhinos avoided being swept, but in the end, the Dallas Rangers won the series 4 to 1. The Philadelphia Silverbacks defeated the Columbus Barons 4 to 2, despite the Baronsâ€™ best efforts. The Chicago Guardians continued their dominance and took out the New York Metros 4 to 1.

Given these results, we have our conference finals. In the East, we have the Chicago Guardians vs the Philadelphia Silverbacks. In the West, we have the Phoenix Scorpions vs the Dallas Rangers. Will Philly be able to overcome the challenge that is Chicago, the No. 1 Seed in the East? Can Dallas move pass Phoenix and make it to the finals? Only time will tell as we inch closer and closer to the end of the 2019-2020 season.

We also have more new coaches in the SICBA and a new GM in the SIBA. Don Lookingbill will be taking over the coaching job at Penn State University. Brooks Ward Jr. will be the head coach of the Louisiana State Tigers. And finally, the San Diego Captains have accepted Izulde Jestor as their new GM. We welcome them all and look forward to seeing how they and their teams fare in the next season.

**Edit:** We have another new head coach in the SICBA, Michael Loveland! He will be coaching the Wyoming Cowboys.

The last few games of the college tournaments are done and in the books. In the United States Invitational Tournament (USIT), the Merrimack Warriors earned their spot in the finals by one point. The Belmont Bruins came out strong in the first half, leading 50 to 43. However, in the second half, the Warriors fought back and scraped by, winning 85 to 84. Despite having four of their starters with double digits points, Belmont could not maintain their lead and allowed Merrimack's bench to force their team to victory. In the end, the Merrimack Warriors became the USIT champions, winning the final game against the Albany Great Danes 79 to 68.

In the Internet Basketball Invitational (IBI), the Saint Josephs Hawks took on the Connecticut Huskies for the championship. Jason Thomas with his 16 points, 3 assists, and 4 rebounds earned the title Player of the Game and took the lead in winning the championship for Connecticut.

In the Championship Basketball Tournament (CBT), Dayton did not have too much trouble in earning their spot in the final, beating UC-Irvine 82 to 70. Oklahoma, on the other hand, nearly lost the lead they had against Vanderbilt. Chris Odle, the senior power forward from Vanderbilt, desperately wanted to move to the next and final round for his last year and brought his A-game, earning 18 points and 20 rebounds (10 of them being offensive). However, the Sooners maintained their lead and won the game 74 to 72, the senior Blake Miller taking charge with his 27 points. The Sooners ended up winning the tournament, defeating Dayton 82 to 60.

In the SICBA tournament, the final four have been named: Wisconsin, Florida, Kansas, and Texas. While most of the games determining the final four were straightforward, the game between the #3 Kansas Jayhawks and #16 Georgetown Hoyas came to a nail-biting finish. After the first half, Georgetown held the lead 38 to 27 with starters on both teams playing well. The Jayhawks, led by the forward Dante Rowland, overtook the Hoyas and within the last few seconds of the game, beat Georgetown 72 to 71.

While these final games were being played, we also had some movement off the court in regards to head coaches. Genie Avery has stepped down as head coach of the Southern California Trojans to take the job at the University of Washington, home of the Huskies. Avery and the Athletic Director of Southern California reportedly got into quite the heated argument. Players heard snippets of the argument, discussing Avery's lack of professionalism and vulgarity-filled speech. A loud shout of "Then I'm \[explicit\] out!" and a door slam signaled the end of the argument as well as Avery's time with USC. When asked for a comment on his decision to take the Huskies' job, he said, "I've admired Washington's program for a long time and so, I'm gonna help them to stick to our now mutual rival."

The Athletic Director at Southern California wasted no time in hiring a replacement. Jron Magcale, a brand new member of the SIBA and SICBA leagues, will be the new head coach of the Trojans. Magcale will also be taking over as GM of the Los Angeles Waves. It'll be very interesting on how the two coaches adjust to their new positions.
