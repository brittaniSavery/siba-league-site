The Simulation International Basketball Association (SIBA) and its related college (SICBA) and developmental (DBL) leagues are a fictional basketball simulation league using the Draft Day Sports: Basketball programs by Wolverine Studios. In the professional league of SIBA, 30 teams and 30 GM all plan, recruit, trade, train, and play in order to take home the coveted prize of the SIBA Championship. Will you be league champion? Or would you rather be the head of your own college basketball program? In the college league of the SICBA, universities and college from all around the United States battle each other to bring the championship to their school.

Whatever your play style, join the SIBA and/or the SICBA and test your basketball coaching and management skills! Read the [professional league rules](/siba/rules) and the [college league rules](/college/rules) to get a good understanding of the workings of the leagues.
