The Simulation International Basketball Association (SIBA) and its related college (SICBA) and developmental (DBL) leagues are a fictional basketball simulation league using the Draft Day Sports: Basketball programs by Wolverine Studios. In the professional league of SIBA, 30 teams and 30 GM all plan, recruit, trade, train, and play in order to take home the coveted prize of the SIBA Championship. Will you be league champion? Or would you rather be the head of your own college basketball program?

## Updates

### December 23, 2020

The last few games of the college tournaments are done and in the books. In the United States Invitational Tournament (USIT), the Merrimack Warriors earned their spot in the finals by one point. The Belmont Bruins came out strong in the first half, leading 50 to 43. However, in the second half, the Warriors fought back and scraped by, winning 85 to 84. Despite having four of their starters with double digits points, Belmont could not maintain their lead and allowed Merrimack's bench to force their team to victory. In the end, the Merrimack Warriors became the USIT champions, winning the final game against the Albany Great Danes 79 to 68.

In the Internet Basketball Invitational (IBI), the Saint Josephs Hawks took on the Connecticut Huskies for the championship. Jason Thomas with his 16 points, 3 assists, and 4 rebounds earned the title Player of the Game and took the lead in winning the championship for Connecticut.

In the Championship Basketball Tournament (CBT), Dayton did not have too much trouble in earning their spot in the final, beating UC-Irvine 82 to 70. Oklahoma, on the other hand, nearly lost the lead they had against Vanderbilt. Chris Odle, the senior power forward from Vanderbilt, desperately wanted to move to the next and final round for his last year and brought his A-game, earning 18 points and 20 rebounds (10 of them being offensive). However, the Sooners maintained their lead and won the game 74 to 72, the senior Blake Miller taking charge with his 27 points. The Sooners ended up winning the tournament, defeating Dayton 82 to 60.

In the SICBA tournament, the final four have been named: Wisconsin, Florida, Kansas, and Texas. While most of the games determining the final four were straightforward, the game between the #3 Kansas Jayhawks and #16 Georgetown Hoyas came to a nail-biting finish. After the first half, Georgetown held the lead 38 to 27 with starters on both teams playing well. The Jayhawks, led by the forward Dante Rowland, overtook the Hoyas and within the last few seconds of the game, beat Georgetown 72 to 71.

While these final games were being played, we also had some movement off the court in regards to head coaches. Genie Avery has stepped down as head coach of the Southern California Trojans to take the job at the University of Washington, home of the Huskies. Avery and the Athletic Director of Southern California reportedly got into quite the heated argument. Players heard snippets of the argument, discussing Avery's lack of professionalism and vulgar-filled speech. A loud shout of "Then I'm [explicit] out!" and a door slam signaled the end of the argument as well as Avery's time with USC. When asked for a comment on his decision to take the Huskies' job, he said, "I've admired Washington's program for a long time and so, I'm gonna help them to stick to our now mutual rival."

The Athletic Director at Southern California wasted no time in hiring a replacement. Jron Magcale, a brand new member of the SIBA and SICBA leagues, will be the new head coach of the Trojans. Magcale will also be taking over as GM of the Los Angeles Waves. It'll be very interesting on how the two coaches adjust to their new positions.

### December 17, 2020

The SICBA tournament, the big one for all the marbles, is finally under way! The first round is already complete and there were some interesting games. In the Buffalo Region, Saint Mary's Gaels took the the #24 Illinois Fighting Illini by surprise, scoring 43 to 23 points in the first half. Illinois attempted to make a comeback, but it was too late. Saint Mary's took the win and is moving to the next round. Their center Clifton Majerus had a great game on both sides of the court with a near double-double: 10 points, 9 rebounds (2 offensive ones), 4 blocks, 2 assists, and 2 steals.

In the Milwaukee Region, there were some upsets and a couple of very close games. The SE Louisiana Lions demolished the #17 Marquette Golden Eagles 80 to 67 with Robert Burditt leading the team with 26 points. Both the Charlotte 49ers and the Memphis Tigers upset their opponents quite handedly and will be facing each other in the next round. After the first half in the Minnesota Golden Gophers vs Kansas State Wildcats game, Kansas State had the lead. But Minnesota was not going down without a fight and in the end, Kansas State managed to hold on until the end, winning only by one point: 63 to 62. The game between the Maryland Terrapins and the #18 Michigan Wolverines actually went into overtime with the Wolverines coming out on top by two points, 89 to 87. Roman Jackson of the Wolverines (22 points) and Dave Demory of the Terrapins (26 points, 9 rebounds, and 7 steals) played amazingly, but there can only be one winner.

In the San Antonio Region, the #21 Cincinnati Bearcats absolutely pulverized the VA Commonwealth Rams, 80 to 45. The Wichita State Shockers managed overtake the #19 Duke Blue Devils, despite the 19 lead changes and 6 ties in the game. At the end The Shockers won with a score of 76 to 73. Four out of their five starters had double-digit points. Emmett Means even had a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds.

In the last region, the Spokane Region, the Butler Bulldogs led at the end of the first half in their match against the Oregon Ducks. However in the second half, the Ducks were relentless in their attack, similar to their real life animal counterpart when chasing people with bread. They outscored the Bulldogs 46 to 33 and finished ahead at the buzzer with a final score of 82 to 72.

As the second round gets underway, I'm looking forward to the games, the plays, and the upsets.

### December 13, 2020

The first round of the professional playoffs have come to a roaring finish. In the West, the #8 Kansas City Koyotes pushed the #1 Phoenix Scorpions to seven games. Despite the Koyotes' efforts, Darrin Johnson scored a massive 46 Points in Game 7 and helped the Scorpions earn their place in the second round.

In the #2 Dallas Rangers vs #7 Oklahoma City Twisters series, the teams traded games for the first four. However, the Rangers took charge of the last two. Chris Cunningham (42 points, 14 rebounds/Game 5) and Michael Lee (32 points, 6 assists/Game 6) took the lead in Games 5 and 6.

With the first two games of the #3 Portland Rhinos vs #6 Seattle Sasquatch series split, Game 3 was forced into overtime by Seattle, scoring 34 points in the fourth quarter and tieing the game. The Rhinos answered back, though, outscoring the Sasquatch and winning Game 3. Corey Riley from the Rhinos quite easily earned Player of the Game with a triple-double: 32 points, 10 assists, and 18 rebounds. Game 4 was a bit of a do-or-die moment for the Sasquatch, since they needed to win and avoid going down 3-1. Another tight game, it went down to the wire in overtime with the Rhinos winning by two points, 126 to 124. In the end, the Rhinos won the series and are heading to the second round to face the Dallas Rangers.

The #4 Denver Peaks started out great, winning the first two games. However, things turned in the #5 Houston Stampede's favor in Game 3. They came out fierce in the first half and while the Peaks attempted to make a comeback, it wasn't enough. The Stampede won Game 3 114 to 113. They used that momentum to win the next three games and thus, the series. Their next opponent will be the Phoenix Scorpions.

Moving to the Eastern Conference, the turbulent fight to earn a spot in the playoffs seemed to have died off or at the very least fizzled down. There were two sweeps. The #1 Chicago Guardians, with the fourth best record in the league during the regular season, knocked out the #8 Boston Nighthawks in four run-of-the-mill games. The second sweep might come as a surprise. Nick Slaughter, the starting small forward for the #2 New Jersey Hoops, injured his ankle one game before the start of the playoffs. This crippled the Hoops' offense and the #7 Philadelphia Silverbacks took advantage of their opponent's weakness. While one of the four games went into overtime and another had only a two-point difference in the final score, the Hoops could not regroup. With their unexpected sweep, the Silverbacks are in the semi-finals.

The #3 Montreal Argonauts vs #6 Columbus Barons series was basically a replay of the regular season. The Argonauts have struggled against the Barons, being 1-2 against them (both loses were lost by double digits). While Game 2 was a huge win for the Argonauts, led by Willie Favors' 47 points, the Barons finished strong and won the series. The young point guard from Russia, Yevgeny "Geny Pig" Davidenko, had a great game to end the series and even earned Play of the Game with 29 points and 10 assists.

Finally, the #4 Indiana Express vs #5 New York Metros series had a great start for Indiana despite two of their starters (Abraham Hirsch and Collier Perez) being injured. While Game 1 went into overtime, the next two games were fairly standard wins. However, more injuries plied on: Lamoni Price with a sore hand, Kenneth Gibson with a strained knee, Beau Smiley with a broken nose, and Ron Cliff with a mild concussion. In Game 4, Indiana only had seven available players. In Game 5, they only had six. Some players stayed on the court for the full 48 minutes for multiple games. One can only imagine how exhausted they must have been. This allowed New York to sweep the last four games necessary to win the series. Not a normal seven-game series but surely an interesting one.

After the first round, we have these match-ups:

**Eastern Conference**  
#1 Chicago Guardians vs #5 New York Metros  
#6 Columbus Barons vs #7 Philadelphia Silverbacks

**Western Conference**  
#1 Phoenix Scorpions vs #5 Houston Stampede
