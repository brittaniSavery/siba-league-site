    <h2>The SIBA</h2>
    <p>
      The Simulation International College Basketball Assoication (SICBA for
      short) was the combined efforts of Kelley and Brittani Avery, a father and
      daughter team. Sharing a love of basketball and statistics, they worked
      together to create the league as a way to spend quality time together.
      Kelley created the teams, logos, and rules of the league while Brittani
      provided her technical expertise to build the website and other important
      tools to support it.
